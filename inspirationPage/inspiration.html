                    <p>Gian loves Andrew Scott’s art. The way Scott uses the frame and incorporates different components into his work is truly fascinating. Gian appreciates how Scott's art deviates from traditional framed artwork while still being highly effective. The attention to detail in each piece and the consistency throughout Scott's body of work are impressive. When Gian sees his art, it sparks thoughts on how similar concepts can be applied as an aspiring UI designer. It's really about thinking outside the box—or in this case, the frame.
