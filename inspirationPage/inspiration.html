                <h3>What inspires you about Andrew Scott?</h3>
                    
                    <p>I love Andrew Scott’s art. The way he uses the frame and different components of it, incorporated into his art, is really fascinating. I love how it is different from traditional framed artwork, yet it’s very effective. The details that go into each piece and the consistency in all of his work are great. When I see his art, it makes me think about how I can apply the same concept as an aspiring UI designer. It’s really thinking outside the box—or in this case… the frame.

                    <p>I’ve always wanted to learn logo design and branding. Will Paterson’s work has always been inspiring, and I watch his process and tutorials here and there. Every time I do, I always tell myself—one day, I’ll make good logos just like him. Also, he has a great story about how he became successful as a content creator and owning his own agency.</p>
