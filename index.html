                <p>I’m a student at San Francisco State University, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Visual Communication with a focus on UX/UI design. Although I am still building experience in the field, I am passionate about applying my skills to real-world projects. Right now, I’m working on designing a website for my local church, which allows me to practice and refine my abilities while learning more about the process of web design.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have a solid foundation in design tools such as Figma and Webflow, along with basic knowledge of Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. My primary interest lies in solving problems through technology and design. I find it exciting to research various challenges and come up with creative, user-centered solutions that not only look good but also work seamlessly.
                <br>
                <br>
                Currently, my main goal is to expand my portfolio by taking on more projects that push me to grow and explore new areas of UX/UI design. I pride myself on my ability to learn quickly and adapt to new challenges, and I have strong organizational skills that help me stay on track with my work. I’m excited to continue developing my skills and contribute to innovative design projects in the future.</p>
